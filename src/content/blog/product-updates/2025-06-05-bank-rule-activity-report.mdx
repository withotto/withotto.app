# See Otto's Daily Work: New Bank Rule Activity Report

We've always believed in transparency at With Otto. Today, we're taking that commitment further by adding bank rule activity information to your daily reconciliation reports.

## What You Can See Now

Your daily reconciliation reports now include complete visibility into Otto's bank rule activity. For each client, you can see:

- **Total transactions matched** across all bank rules that day
- **Individual rule performance** showing exactly how many transactions each rule processed
- **Clear categorisation** by rule type and associated Xero accounts

No more wondering what Otto has been up to. You'll know precisely which automated processes are working hardest and delivering the most value.

## Why This Matters

Bank rule visibility serves two important purposes. First, it helps you understand Otto's impact on your daily workflow. When your report shows "14 transactions matched across 4 rules," you know exactly how much manual work Otto has saved you.

Second, it provides valuable insights into your automation patterns. You might discover that certain types of transactions are being processed more efficiently than others, or identify opportunities to create additional rules for similar clients.

## Looking Ahead

This visibility feature is the foundation for something bigger. We're planning to use these insights to identify high-performing bank rules that might benefit your other clients too. Think of it as Otto learning from your best automation setups and suggesting similar improvements elsewhere.

The bank rule activity information is included in daily reconciliation reports for all With Otto users. Check your latest report to see what Otto's been working on today.
