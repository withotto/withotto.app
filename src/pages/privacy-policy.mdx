## How we collect your personal data

We may collect data about you by you providing the data directly to us (for example by filling in forms on our site or by sending us emails). We may automatically collect certain data from you as you use our website by using cookies and similar technologies. Please see our [cookie policy](/cookie-policy/) for more details about this.

We may receive data from third parties such as analytics providers such as Google based outside the EU, advertising networks such as Meta based outside the EU, search information providers such as Google based outside the EU, providers of technical, payment and delivery services, such as data brokers or aggregators.

## Marketing communications

Our lawful ground of processing your personal data to send you marketing communications is either your consent or our legitimate interests (namely to grow our business).

Under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, we may send you marketing communications if (i) you made a purchase or asked for information from us about our goods or services or (ii) you agreed to receive marketing communications and in each case you have not opted out of receiving such communications since. Under these regulations, if you are a limited company, we may send you marketing emails without your consent. However, you can still opt out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time.

We will not share your personal data with any third party for their own marketing purposes without your express consent.

You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you.

If you opt out of receiving marketing communications this opt-out does not apply to personal data provided as a result of other transactions, such as a contract for us to provide you with the Service.

## Disclosures of your personal data

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below:

- Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.
- Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers.
- Government bodies that require us to report processing activities.

We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

## International transfers

We are subject to the provisions of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 that protect your personal data.

When we transfer your personal data outside the UK, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place. We may transfer your data:

1. To countries deemed adequate under UK data protection laws
2. Using the UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA)
3. Using EU Standard Contractual Clauses with the UK Addendum
4. To organisations under Binding Corporate Rules approved by the UK Information Commissioner's Office

For transfers to the United States, we rely on the UK IDTA or the UK Addendum to EU Standard Contractual Clauses, as the EU-US Privacy Shield is no longer valid for UK transfers.

We regularly review our international transfer mechanisms to ensure they meet current UK requirements. You can request information about these safeguards by contacting us.

## Data security

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorised disclosure or access. We may use third-party products and services to secure or store your information.

Where you have chosen a password, which enables you to access the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You should not share this password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via internet is not completely secure. Although we will work hard to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to the Service; use of the Service is at your own risk.

We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach if we are legally required to.

Personal information is stored and processed in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as it applies in the UK, tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018.

We are registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), registration number ZA335556.

## Data retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for we look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## Your legal rights

Under data protection laws you have rights in relation to your personal data that include the right to request access, correction, erasure, restriction, transfer, to object to processing, to portability of data and (where the lawful ground of processing is consent) to withdraw consent.

You can see more about these rights at [the Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/).

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex, or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you.

If you are not happy with any aspect of how we collect and use your data, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues ([www.ico.org.uk](https://www.ico.org.uk)). We should be grateful if you would contact us first if you do have a complaint so that we can try to resolve it for you.
