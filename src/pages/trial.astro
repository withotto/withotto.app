          Your onboarding session is more than a product demoâ€”it's a
          collaborative consultation where we understand your practice's needs
          and offer specific advice about getting the most out of Otto. We will
          walk you through every aspect of the system, from initial setup to
          daily operation, ensuring you get the most value from your trial.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-3xl">During your session, we will:</p>
        <ul class="mx-auto max-w-3xl list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            Find out what you're hoping to achieve by bringing Otto into your
            practice
          </li>
          <li>
            Explain how Otto's machine learning adapts to your clients'
            purchases and sales
          </li>
          <li>
            Guide you through the With Otto portal, showing you how to monitor
            and configure Otto
          </li>
          <li>
            Help you invite Otto to your practice and assign the first group of
            trial clients
          </li>
          <li>
            Answer any questions about security, compliance, and best practices
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          Why do we prefer personal onboarding? Because every practice is
          unique. This dedicated time ensures you have all the information you
          need to get Otto working to his maximum potential, leading to better
          results from day one.
