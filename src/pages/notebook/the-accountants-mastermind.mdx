## What You Get When Trying With Otto

We believe trying new technology should be straightforward and supported, which is why we provide:

### Complimentary One-Hour Onboarding Call
A dedicated session with our team to explain With Otto, answer your questions, and ensure you can make the most of your trial period. This isn't a sales pitch—it's a genuine consultation to help you understand whether Otto is right for your practice.

### Completely Unlimited One-Month Trial
Experience Otto with no restrictions: unlimited clients, unlimited reconciliations, and full access to all features. There are no hidden limits or charges during your trial period.

### Otto Ready from Day One
We'll handle all the setup and training before your trial begins. Otto will be configured and ready to work on your reconciliations from the moment your trial starts, requiring no time investment from you or your team.

## What Happens During Your Onboarding Call?

Your onboarding session is designed to give you confidence and clarity about automation in your practice:

- **Understanding Your Needs**: We'll discuss your current reconciliation challenges and explore how Otto's machine learning can address them specifically
- **Practical Demonstration**: See Otto's portal in action, understanding how to monitor automated reconciliations and manage your client assignments
- **Integration Guidance**: Learn how Otto works alongside your existing processes without disrupting your team's workflow
- **Security and Compliance**: Get detailed answers about data protection, security measures, and compliance considerations
- **Realistic Expectations**: We'll be honest about what Otto can and cannot do, ensuring you have accurate expectations for your trial

## Why This Partnership Matters

The Accountants' Mastermind has built a community focused on genuine business improvement rather than flashy marketing promises. This aligns perfectly with our approach at With Otto—we believe in transparency, realistic expectations, and letting our technology speak for itself.

We won't oversell Otto's abilities or claim it's suitable for every practice. During your onboarding call, we'll have an honest conversation about whether Otto is the right fit for your specific circumstances. Sometimes, our competitors might be more suitable for particular use cases, and we're not afraid to acknowledge that.

## Ready to Explore Intelligent Reconciliation?

Your complimentary onboarding call includes no obligations beyond giving Otto a fair trial. We're confident that once you experience automated reconciliation with proper machine learning, you'll understand why practices are moving away from manual processes.

Book your session today and join the growing number of practices that have discovered there's a better way to handle bank reconciliation.
