import BookingForm from "@components/BookingForm.astro";


Your onboarding session builds on what you've learned today about automation. It's a collaborative consultation where we'll show you how Otto's machine learning capabilities complement your existing automation tools, including Apron. We'll walk through every aspect of the system, ensuring you can immediately start saving time on bank reconciliation.

In your personalised session, we will:

- Create a plan for integrating Otto alongside your existing tools, including Apron
- Show you how Otto's machine learning adapts to your specific workflow patterns
- Guide you through the With Otto portal, demonstrating how to monitor and manage automated reconciliation
- Help you invite Otto to your practice and set up your first group of clients
- Address any questions about security, compliance, and best practices

Why do we recommend personal onboarding? Because while automation principles are universal, every practice has unique needs and workflows. This dedicated time ensures you have the knowledge to get Otto working at his maximum potential, leading to better results from day one.

Think of it as your blueprint for combining the power of Otto's intelligent reconciliation with your existing automation tools. Together, we'll create a streamlined workflow that lets you focus on growing your practice and strengthening client relationships.
