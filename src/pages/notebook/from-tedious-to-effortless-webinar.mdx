## What We Covered

In this practical session, we explored:

### Building Automation Step-by-Step

How to build automation progressively, even if you're starting from scratch. We walked through the practical steps that practices take when introducing Otto to their reconciliation workflow.

### Getting More from Your Existing Tools

How to maximise the tools you already use without adding unnecessary software to your stack. Otto works alongside your existing processes, enhancing rather than replacing them.

### Understanding Where Otto Fits

Where Otto fits into your practice and how it supports, rather than replaces, your team.

### The Practical Benefits

How Otto can:

- Free up time for you and your team
- Reduce errors and stress in the reconciliation process
- Build a smoother, more scalable reconciliation workflow

## Why With Otto?

With Otto was created by an accountancy practice with first-hand knowledge of bookkeepers' and accountants' challenges. We understand what it's like to face the same reconciliation tasks month after month.

Our approach is different from typical SaaS businesses:

- **Transparent**: We publish real-time statistics on our website and display clear pricing with usage calculators
- **Honest**: We acknowledge that our product won't work for everyone, and sometimes competitors may be a better fit
- **Straightforward**: Our sales process is designed to be clear and pressure-free

We believe Otto offers the most accurate reconciliation solution in the industry, and we're confident that once you experience automated reconciliation with proper machine learning, you'll understand why practices are making the switch.
