## Why With Otto?

With Otto was created by an accountancy practice with first-hand knowledge of bookkeepers' and accountants' challenges. We understand what it's like to face the same reconciliation tasks month after month.

Our approach is different from typical SaaS businesses:

- **Transparent**: We publish real-time statistics on our website and display clear pricing with usage calculators
- **Honest**: We acknowledge that our product won't work for everyone, and sometimes competitors may be a better fit
- **Straightforward**: Our sales process is designed to be clear and pressure-free

We believe Otto offers the most accurate reconciliation solution in the industry, and we're confident that once you experience automated reconciliation with proper machine learning, you'll understand why practices are making the switch.
