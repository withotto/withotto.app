            Important: Is With Otto right for your business?
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            With Otto is designed for businesses with established finance
            expertise. To use Otto effectively and safely, your organisation
            needs:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
            <li>
              An internal finance function (CFO, finance director, qualified
              accountant or bookkeeper)
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone with solid understanding of bank reconciliation principles
              and Xero
            </li>
            <li>
              The expertise to properly configure and monitor automated
              reconciliation
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Incorrect reconciliation setup can
            create accounting errors that require manual correction. Our support
            team can help with Otto's functionality, but we cannot provide general
            bookkeeping guidance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">
          If your business meets these requirements, Otto can transform how your
          finance team handles reconciliation. Our machine learning technology
          automatically matches bank transactions with invoices, bills, and
          transfers—eliminating the tedious manual work that takes hours each
          month.
        </p>

        <p class="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          Unlike solutions designed for accountancy practices, this direct
          business offering focuses on your internal finance operations. Otto
          learns your company's transaction patterns, making reconciliation
          faster and more accurate over time.
