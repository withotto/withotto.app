## What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small text file that websites store on your device. These files help websites remember your preferences and how you use them. For example, cookies can remember your login details, language preferences, or items in your shopping cart. They also help website owners understand how people use their sites, enabling them to make improvements based on this information.

Cookies are used by nearly all websites and do not harm your system. If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be altered within your browser settings. You can use these settings to completely block cookies. By not blocking cookies and continuing to browse you are authorising the use of cookies. If you block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all, or parts, of the With Otto service.

Cookies are either:

- **Session cookies:** these are only stored on your computer during your web session and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. They usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page, but they do not collect any personal data from your computer, or
- **Persistent cookies:** these are stored as a file on your computer and remain there when you close your browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you return to that website.

They can also be categorised as follows:

- **Strictly necessary cookies:** essential to enable you to use the website effectively, such as when buying a service/product, and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the services available to you on our website cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.
- **Performance cookies:** enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our website. For example, they allow us to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the site are most popular.
- **Functionality cookies:** allow our website to remember choices you make, and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. They may also be used to provide services you have requested, such as viewing a video. The information collected by these cookies is usually anonymised.
